Established in 1957, BOC is one of the earliest independent oversight boards of custodial and detention settings in the United States. The Mayor, City Council and presiding justices of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First and Second Judicial Departments (in joint nomination with the Mayor) appoint its members. The City Charter mandates the Boardâ€™s five functions:  â€¢	Establish and ensure compliance with minimum standards â€œfor the care, custody, correction, treatment, supervision, and discipline of all persons held or confined under the jurisdiction of the Department of Correctionâ€ â€¢	Investigate serious incidents â€¢	Review grievances from people in custody and staff â€¢	Evaluate the performance of the Department of Correction â€¢	Make recommendations on areas of key correctional planning  The Board established the Minimum Standards on jail conditions in 1979, on mental health care in 1985, and on health care in 1991. In 2007, BOC finished a comprehensive review of the Minimum Standards and adopted a series of amendments. In 2015-2016, the Board promulgated rules codifying ground-breaking criminal justice reforms. This included the Cityâ€™s ending of punitive segregation for 16-21 year olds and individuals with serious physical/mental health disabilities. The Board also recently enacted a new chapter of its Minimum Standards that are based on national standards underlying the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). These new rules require action which is specifically tailored to detecting, preventing and responding to sexual abuse and sexual harassment in the Cityâ€™s jails.

Established in 1957, BOC is one of the earliest independent oversight boards of custodial and detention settings in the United States. The Mayor, City Council and presiding justices of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First and Second Judicial Departments (in joint nomination with the Mayor) appoint its members. The City Charter mandates the Boardâ€™s five functions:  â€¢	Establish and ensure compliance with minimum standards â€œfor the care, custody, correction, treatment, supervision, and discipline of all persons held or confined under the jurisdiction of the Department of Correctionâ€ â€¢	Investigate serious incidents â€¢	Review grievances from people in custody and staff â€¢	Evaluate the performance of the Department of Correction â€¢	Make recommendations on areas of key correctional planning  The Board established the Minimum Standards on jail conditions in 1979, on mental health care in 1985, and on health care in 1991. In 2007, BOC finished a comprehensive review of the Minimum Standards and adopted a series of amendments. In 2015-2016, the Board promulgated rules codifying ground-breaking criminal justice reforms. This included the Cityâ€™s ending of punitive segregation for 16-21 year olds and individuals with serious physical/mental health disabilities. The Board also recently enacted a new chapter of its Minimum Standards that are based on national standards underlying the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). These new rules require action which is specifically tailored to detecting, preventing and responding to sexual abuse and sexual harassment in the Cityâ€™s jails.

In addition, the Bureau contributes to improving storm water management in NYC through our Green Infrastructure Program by maintaining thousands of curbside rain gardens, referred to as bioswales.

DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees. DEP delivers more than 1.1 billion gallons per day of the highest quality drinking water to 8.3 million New York City (the City) residents and more than 1 million people in Upstate New York and has a wastewater conveyance and treatment system capable of processing over 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater per day to protect the environment and the Cityâ€™s surrounding waterways.  The Bureau of Wastewater Treatment (BWT) is responsible for the operation and maintenance of all facilities related to the treatment of sewage within the five boroughs of the City. This includes 14 wastewater treatment plants, sludge dewatering facilities, collections facilities (pumping stations, combined sewer overflow retention facilities, regulators, tide gates, etc.), wastewater laboratories and harbor vessels.  Wastewater utilities are moving from handlers of wastewater to managers of sustainable resources and watershed-scale environmental leaders seeking the least-cost/highest return environmental and social solutions. We are embracing best practices and collaboration to ensure a sustainable future that minimizes waste, maximizes resources, protects our ratepayers, improves the community and embraces innovation. We have therefore been transforming from an agency that conveys and treats wastewater to a manager of valuable resources that is recognized as an essential partner in local economic development and an important member of the watershed community seeking to deliver maximum environmental benefits at the least cost to society.  The BWT Director of Business Enterprise Systems (BES) will lead a team and strategically implement best industry practices, lead the development and implementation of Culture of Continuous Improvement Programs, and build best-in-class business systems across BWT. This senior position requires a self-motivated individual with advanced communication skills, a solid working knowledge of O&M activities (including the use of computer systems), project management procedures, budgeting,  engineering practices and construction activities (including startup and commissioning) so as to facilitate successful planning, design, construction and commissioning of both capital and expense infrastructure projects.    The BES Director reports directly to the BWT Assistant Commissioner for Capital Planning and Delivery and needs to be a strong leader in this complex business environment. The BES Director will be tasked with developing and utilizing consistent and reliable means and methods for the Bureau and Agency in the examination and tabulation of data, analysis and reports. The BES Director is expected to bring programmatic improvements to all levels of responsibility through analysis, development of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and adoption of industry best practices (such as Project Management Institute (PMI), Lean, Six Sigma, and other applicable programs).     As Directed by the BWT Assistant Commissioner for Capital Planning and Delivery, the Director of Business Enterprise Systems will be engaged in the following programs:  Leadership: Provide leadership and management for projects/initiatives as required, facilitating team efforts and helping to define project goals, timelines, resource requirements and planning. Utilize â€œLeanâ€ and other management tools such as process mapping and visual management to analyze processes, track improvements, communicate, and facilitate decision-making. Lead the Capital Planning and Delivery organization in improving efficiencies and effectiveness at all levels.

DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees. DEP delivers more than 1.1 billion gallons per day of the highest quality drinking water to 8.3 million New York City (the City) residents and more than 1 million people in Upstate New York and has a wastewater conveyance and treatment system capable of processing over 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater per day to protect the environment and the Cityâ€™s surrounding waterways.  The Bureau of Wastewater Treatment (BWT) is responsible for the operation and maintenance of all facilities related to the treatment of sewage within the five boroughs of the City. This includes 14 wastewater treatment plants, sludge dewatering facilities, collections facilities (pumping stations, combined sewer overflow retention facilities, regulators, tide gates, etc.), wastewater laboratories and harbor vessels.  Wastewater utilities are moving from handlers of wastewater to managers of sustainable resources and watershed-scale environmental leaders seeking the least-cost/highest return environmental and social solutions. We are embracing best practices and collaboration to ensure a sustainable future that minimizes waste, maximizes resources, protects our ratepayers, improves the community and embraces innovation. We have therefore been transforming from an agency that conveys and treats wastewater to a manager of valuable resources that is recognized as an essential partner in local economic development and an important member of the watershed community seeking to deliver maximum environmental benefits at the least cost to society.  The BWT Director of Business Enterprise Systems (BES) will lead a team and strategically implement best industry practices, lead the development and implementation of Culture of Continuous Improvement Programs, and build best-in-class business systems across BWT.

The BES Director is expected to bring programmatic improvements to all levels of responsibility through analysis, development of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and adoption of industry best practices (such as Project Management Institute (PMI), Lean, Six Sigma, and other applicable programs).

DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees.  DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the systemâ€™s 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.  The Bureau of Wastewater Treatment (BWT) is responsible for the operation and maintenance of all facilities related to the treatment of sewage within the five boroughs of the City. This includes 14 wastewater treatment plants, sludge dewatering facilities, collections facilities (pumping stations, combined sewer overflow retention facilities, regulators, tide gates, etc.), wastewater laboratories and harbor vessels.  Wastewater utilities are moving from handlers of wastewater to managers of sustainable resources and watershed-scale environmental leaders seeking the least-cost/highest return environmental and social solutions. We are embracing best practices and collaboration to ensure a sustainable future that minimizes waste, maximizes resources, protects our ratepayers, improves the community and embraces innovation. We have therefore been transforming from an agency that conveys and treats wastewater to a manager of valuable resources that is recognized as an essential partner in local economic development and an important member of the watershed community seeking to deliver maximum environmental benefits at the least cost to society.  The Performance Analyst will report directly to the Division Chief of Operations Support. They will be responsible for performing multi-faceted assessments of the wastewater treatment processes at various facilities to continually advance Operational Excellence objectives. The Facility Managers for the treatments plants will use the Process Analystsâ€™ findings to optimize non-labor efficiency.  Some of the specific tasks of a Performance Analyst include establishing chemical selection and dosing criteria for nitrogen-removal processes, field testing polymers to select the most cost-effective products, reviewing unit-specific energy utilization to identify potential savings, evaluating new equipment in the marketplace, advising process-control engineers, reviewing engineering designs, and meeting with regulators regarding compliance matters. The majority of a typical workday will be spent at field locations.   The Performance Analyst will work with Operations staff in developing Standard Operating Procedures to implement approved initiatives. These analysts will frequently meet with OpX consultants to discuss vet suggested improvements. Performance Analysts periodically carry out experimental activities, independently or as a team, to determine if enhancements to various treatment processes are viable. Collaboration with the bureauâ€™s Process Development section to research and test innovative technologies is also required. The Performance Analyst may be asked to prepare and administer chemical and service contracts, and provide input to in-house engineering staff for equipment selection.   Periodically, a Performance Analyst may fill in for a process control engineer.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Only those that have filed for DCAS Civil Service Exam 9003 for Associate Project Manager (APM) will be considered. Candidates selected to fill an APM position from this posting will be appointed on a provisional basis. As a provisional employee, you will be required to take and pass the APM civil service examination, which is expected to be held on Saturday, January 19, 2019.","One year of full-time satisfactory experience in supervising employees performing project management work, such as planning, administering, managing, coordinating, or expediting, on engineering and/or architectural and/or landscape architectural projects, or supervising a construction project with a value of $1,000,000 or more, and either:  1.

Established in 1957, BOC is one of the earliest independent oversight boards of custodial and detention settings in the United States. The Mayor, City Council and presiding justices of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First and Second Judicial Departments (in joint nomination with the Mayor) appoint its members. The City Charter mandates the Boardâ€™s five functions: â€¢	Establish and ensure compliance with minimum standards for the care, custody, correction, treatment, supervision, and discipline of all persons held or confined under the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction; â€¢	Investigate serious incidents; â€¢	Review grievances from inmates and staff; â€¢	Evaluate the performance of the Department of Correction; and, â€¢	Make recommendations on areas of key correctional planning.  The Board established the Minimum Standards on jail conditions in 1979, on mental health care in 1985, and on health care in 1991. In 2007, BOC finished a comprehensive review of the Minimum Standards and adopted a series of amendments. In 2015-2016, the Board promulgated rules codifying ground-breaking criminal justice reforms. This included the Cityâ€™s ending of punitive segregation for 16-21year olds and individuals with serious physical/mental health disabilities. In late 2016, the Board enacted a new chapter of its Minimum Standards that are based on national standards underlying the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). These new rules require action which is specifically tailored to detecting, preventing and responding to sexual abuse and sexual harassment in the Cityâ€™s jails. Recently, BOC commenced rulemaking on restrictive housing and going forward, will update its Mental Health Minimum Standards.  Over the past two years, to expand its research, monitoring and rule-making efforts, the Board has nearly doubled its annual budget (currently $3 million) and its staff (currently 28, with planned expansion to 38). With offices in lower Manhattan and Rikers Island, BOC works regularly with the Department of Correction and Health + Hospitals, and often with other government and external partners, on a wide variety of criminal justice issues germane to its oversight responsibilities.

About the New York City Board of Correction The New York City Board of Correction (BOC) is a nine-person, non-judicial oversight board, which regulates, monitors, and inspects the correctional facilities of the City. Established in 1957, BOC is one of the earliest independent oversight boards of custodial and detention settings in the United States. The Mayor, City Council and presiding justices of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First and Second Judicial Departments (in joint nomination with the Mayor) appoint its members. The City Charter mandates the Boardâ€™s five functions: â€¢	Establish and ensure compliance with minimum standards for the care, custody, correction, treatment, supervision, and discipline of all persons held or confined under the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction; â€¢	Investigate serious incidents; â€¢	Review grievances from inmates and staff; â€¢	Evaluate the performance of the Department of Correction; and, â€¢	Make recommendations on areas of key correctional planning.  The Board established the Minimum Standards on jail conditions in 1979, on mental health care in 1985, and on health care in 1991. In 2007, BOC finished a comprehensive review of the Minimum Standards and adopted a series of amendments. In 2015-2016, the Board promulgated rules codifying ground-breaking criminal justice reforms. This included the Cityâ€™s ending of punitive segregation for 16-21 year olds and individuals with serious physical/mental health disabilities. In late 2016, the Board enacted a new chapter of its Minimum Standards that are based on national standards underlying the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). These new rules require action which is specifically tailored to detecting, preventing and responding to sexual abuse and sexual harassment in the Cityâ€™s jails. Recently, BOC commenced rulemaking on restrictive housing and going forward, will update its Mental Health Minimum Standards.  Over the past two years, to expand its research, monitoring and rule-making efforts, the Board has nearly doubled its annual budget to $ 3 million and its staff to 28 (with planned expansion to 36). With offices in lower Manhattan and Rikers Island, BOC works regularly with the Department of Correction and Health + Hospitals, and often with other government and   external partners, on a wide variety of criminal justice issues germane to its oversight responsibilities. The Board brings to this work a strong emphasis on data-sharing, data-driven decision making and public reporting. In keeping with major reforms occurring at the national, state and local level, the Board recently re-envisioned its mission: to carry out independent oversight and enact regulation in support of safer, fairer, smaller and more humane jails.",For City employees: Go to Employee Self-Service (ESS) - www.nyc.gov/ess and search for Job ID #399528   Please submit a resume and cover letter.
